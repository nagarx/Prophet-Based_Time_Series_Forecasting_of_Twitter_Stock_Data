## Project Description:
Prophet is a powerful time series forecasting library for Python developed by Facebook's Core Data Science team. It is designed to handle time series datasets with multiple seasonalities, changing trends, and holiday effects. Prophet is built on top of a decomposable time series model with three main componentsâ€”trend, seasonality, and holidays.

In this project, we'll cover the following:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Twitter stock price data.

- Interactive plots for data analysis using Plotly.

- The Prophet model in Python for time series forecasting of the Twitter stock price data.

## Technologies:
- Prophet
- Python
- Pandas
- Plotly



# Time Series Forecasting with Prophet

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`prophet_time_series_forecasting.ipynb`) dedicated to forecasting time series data using the Prophet model. The project focuses on analyzing and predicting stock market trends, specifically Twitter's stock data, leveraging the power of Facebook's Prophet model for robust and accurate forecasts.

### Key Features
- Data manipulation and analysis using `pandas` and `numpy`.
- Visualization of time series data with `matplotlib` and `plotly`.
- Implementation of the Prophet model for predictive analysis.
- Detailed visualization of forecast components and changepoints.
- Evaluation of model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Theoretical Foundations
The project applies sophisticated time series forecasting techniques. The Prophet model, developed by Facebook, uses an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with daily, weekly, and yearly seasonality, plus holiday effects. It is well-suited for data that exhibits strong seasonal effects.

### Mathematical Representation
The underlying model of Prophet is represented as:
$$y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + \epsilon_t$$
Where:
- $y(t)$ is the forecasted value.
- $g(t)$ represents the trend component.
- $s(t)$ accounts for seasonality (weekly, yearly).
- $h(t)$ denotes holiday effects.
- $\epsilon_t$ is the error term.

## Data Preparation and Visualization

The initial phase of the project involves preparing and visualizing the data, crucial for understanding the underlying patterns and trends.

### Data Loading and Preprocessing
- **Loading Data**: The dataset `TWITTER.csv` is loaded into a DataFrame.
- **Data Conversion**: The 'Date' column is converted to a datetime object for accurate time series analysis.
- **Preliminary Statistics**: Basic statistical analysis (`df.describe()`) and DataFrame information (`df.info()`) are used to gain initial insights.

### Visualization Techniques
- **Scatter Plots**: Visualization of each data column over time is done using scatter plots.
- **OHLC and Candlestick Charts**: These charts provide detailed views of stock price movements, essential for financial analysis.

### Mathematical Concept
Data preprocessing and visualization are guided by the principle of exploratory data analysis (EDA), aiming to uncover patterns and anomalies. EDA is often summarized as:
$$EDA = \text{Visualization} + \text{Statistics}$$

## Time Series Analysis with Prophet

This project employs Facebook's Prophet model for robust and sophisticated time series forecasting. Prophet is especially effective for datasets with strong seasonal effects.

### Implementing Prophet
- **Model Initialization**: The Prophet model is initialized with default settings, and also with a specific `changepoint_prior_scale` for monthly predictions.
- **Data Preparation**: The dataset is restructured to fit Prophet's requirements, with 'Date' as 'ds' and the target variable (e.g., 'Close' price) as 'y'.

### Forecasting
- **Daily and Monthly Forecasts**: The model is trained to make predictions on both daily and monthly scales, offering a comprehensive view of potential future trends.

### Theoretical Aspect
Prophet's model is based on an additive regression framework, suitable for time series data with irregular trends and seasonalities. Its mathematical representation is:
$$y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + \epsilon_t$$
where $g(t)$ models non-linear trends, $s(t)$ captures periodic changes (seasonality), and $h(t)$ represents the effects of holidays.

### Changepoint Analysis
- **Changepoint Identification**: The model identifies critical points where there is a significant shift in the trend, providing insight into potential market reactions.

### Component Analysis
- **Decomposing Forecast Components**: Separate plots for trend, yearly, and weekly seasonality reveal intricate patterns and cyclic behavior in the data.

## Model Evaluation

Evaluating the model's performance is crucial for validating its effectiveness in forecasting.

### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- **Accuracy Assessment**: The MAE metric is used to quantify the average magnitude of errors in the predictions, calculated as:
$$MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i|$$
where $y_i$ are the true values, and $\hat{y}_i$ are the predicted values.

### Actual vs. Predicted Comparison
- **Visual Analysis**: A line chart comparing actual and predicted values is created, providing a visual representation of the model's prediction accuracy.

## Conclusion

### Project Summary
This project demonstrates the application of the Prophet model in forecasting time series data, specifically focusing on Twitter's stock prices. Through a series of steps - from data preprocessing and visualization to in-depth time series analysis and model evaluation - we gain valuable insights into the stock's future behavior.

### Insights and Implications
- The ability to forecast at both daily and monthly intervals allows for strategic planning and decision-making.
- Identifying changepoints and analyzing forecast components offers an understanding of underlying trends and patterns.
- The evaluation through MAE provides a measure of the model's reliability and accuracy.

### Future Directions
Future enhancements could include:
- Exploring additional parameters and settings in the Prophet model for improved accuracy.
- Integrating external data sources to enrich the analysis.
- Applying the model to other financial or non-financial time series datasets.
