## 1. Introduction
In this project, we aim to forecast Twitter stock prices using the Prophet library. The focus is not only on building a predictive model but also on understanding the underlying data through extensive analysis and interactive visualization techniques.

## 2. Data Loading and Preliminary Analysis

In this foundational stage of our project, we begin by loading the Twitter stock price data. The dataset, `TWITTER.csv`, is a rich collection of historical stock prices, which forms the basis for our time series analysis. 

### Key Steps and Theoretical Background:
- **Data Integrity Check**: Ensuring the data is complete and free from corruption is vital. This step is crucial for maintaining the reliability of our analysis.
- **Initial Data Exploration**: A cursory look at the data helps us understand its structure, including the range of dates covered, the frequency of data points, and the types of variables included.

### Theoretical Considerations:
- **Time Series Data Characteristics**: The nature of time series data is inherently sequential, and its analysis requires specialized techniques different from cross-sectional data.
- **Importance of Date-Time Parsing**: Correctly interpreting the date-time information is critical for time series analysis, as it affects how we model trends and seasonality.

This stage sets the tone for our analysis, ensuring that the data is ready for the more intricate exploratory data analysis (EDA) and subsequent forecasting tasks.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA phase is a critical component of our project where we dive deep into the Twitter stock price data to uncover underlying patterns, trends, and anomalies. This stage is not just about visualizing data, but about understanding the story it tells.

### Key Components and Methodologies:
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifying long-term movements in stock prices. We look for patterns indicating upward, downward, or cyclic movements, crucial for understanding the stock's behavior over time.
- **Seasonality Detection**: Assessing whether the stock prices exhibit regular patterns over specific intervals (like days, weeks, months, or seasons). This helps in recognizing predictable fluctuations.
- **Outlier Identification**: Spotting and investigating anomalies in the data that deviate from typical patterns. These outliers can indicate extraordinary market events or data collection errors.

### Theoretical Aspects:
- **Data Visualization**: Using graphs to visualize trends, seasonality, and outliers. These visual representations are key to comprehending complex data relationships.
- **Statistical Summaries**: Employing statistical measures to quantify aspects of the data, such as mean, median, variance, etc. This analysis provides a numerical backdrop for our visual findings.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examining the relationships between different variables in the dataset to identify potential drivers of stock price movements.

### Insights Gained:
Through EDA, we gain valuable insights into Twitter's stock price behavior. This includes understanding how external events or inherent company characteristics might influence stock prices. The findings from this phase are instrumental in informing our forecasting model in terms of feature selection and model specification.

## 4. Model Building with Prophet

After thorough exploratory analysis, we progress to the core of our project: building the forecasting model using Prophet. Prophet stands out for its ability to handle the complexities of time series data, making it an ideal choice for our stock price prediction task.

### Key Steps in Model Building:
- **Model Initialization**: We begin by creating an instance of the Prophet model. This step involves setting up the model's basic configuration and parameters.
- **Trend and Seasonality Configuration**: Given the insights from EDA, we configure the model to capture the identified trends and seasonal patterns. This includes specifying the seasonality type and adjusting trend flexibility.
- **Incorporating External Factors**: If identified as significant during EDA, external factors like market events or macroeconomic indicators can be included in the model to improve its predictive power.

### Theoretical Foundations:
- **Additive Time Series Model**: Prophet is based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with daily, weekly, and yearly seasonality, plus holiday effects. This approach is particularly effective for business forecast tasks.
- **Handling Overfitting and Underfitting**: Careful tuning of parameters is essential to avoid overfitting or underfitting, ensuring the model is generalizable and robust.

### Model Training and Refinement:
- **Training the Model**: The model is trained on historical data, learning to predict future stock prices.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Based on initial performance, we iteratively adjust the model's hyperparameters to improve its forecasting accuracy.

### Insights from Model Building:
This phase allows us to develop a nuanced understanding of Twitter's stock price dynamics and how well they can be captured using Prophet. The process of model tuning and refinement helps us in crafting a forecasting tool that is not only accurate but also interpretable.

## Mathematical Framework of the Prophet Model

The Prophet model employs an additive time series forecasting model, which can be expressed as:

$$y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + \epsilon_t$$

Where:
- $y(t)$ is the predicted value.
- $g(t)$ represents the trend component, modeling non-periodic changes.
- $s(t)$ denotes the seasonality component, capturing periodic changes (daily, weekly, yearly).
- $h(t)$ encapsulates the effects of holidays or events.
- $\epsilon_t$ is the error term, accounting for any idiosyncratic changes not accommodated by the model.

### Trend Component - $g(t)$
The trend, $g(t)$, is modeled using a piecewise linear or logistic growth curve, depending on the nature of the data:

For a linear growth model:
$$g(t) = k \cdot t + m$$

For a logistic growth model:
$$g(t) = \frac{C}{1 + e^{-k(t - m)}}$$

Where:
- $C$ is the carrying capacity (maximum achievable value).
- $k$ is the growth rate.
- $m$ is an offset parameter.

### Seasonality Component - $s(t)$
Seasonality, $s(t)$, is modeled using Fourier series to provide a flexible representation of periodic effects:

$$s(t) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left( a_n \cos\left(\frac{2\pi nt}{P}\right) + b_n \sin\left(\frac{2\pi nt}{P}\right) \right)$$

Where:
- $N$ is the number of Fourier terms.
- $P$ is the period (e.g., 365.25 for yearly seasonality).
- $a_n$ and $b_n$ are coefficients to be fitted.

### Holiday Component - $h(t)$
The holiday component, $h(t)$, accounts for predictable irregularities on specific dates, like holidays or events.

### Conclusion
These mathematical formulations underpin the Prophet model, enabling it to adeptly handle complex time series data with various intrinsic patterns and external influences.

## 5. Model Evaluation and Comparison

Once the Prophet model is built and trained, the next critical step is to evaluate its performance and compare its predictions against actual stock prices. This phase is crucial to assess the practical utility of the model.

### Evaluation Metrics and Techniques:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: We use MAE to measure the average magnitude of errors in our predictions, providing a clear, interpretable metric of model accuracy.
- **Comparative Visualization**: Plotting the predicted values against the actual stock prices over time. This visual comparison helps in assessing how well the model captures the trends and fluctuations in the data.

### Theoretical Considerations:
- **Model Accuracy vs. Complexity**: Striking a balance between model accuracy and complexity is essential. An overly complex model may fit the training data well but fail to generalize to new data.
- **Handling Anomalies and Seasonal Effects**: The model's ability to handle anomalies and capture seasonal effects accurately is critical for its performance, especially in volatile markets like stock trading.

### Insights from Evaluation:
- **Model Strengths and Limitations**: The evaluation phase sheds light on the strengths and limitations of our Prophet model, offering insights into its predictive capabilities and areas for improvement.
- **Practical Implications**: The comparison of predicted and actual values provides a direct measure of the model's utility in real-world forecasting scenarios, such as investment decision-making.

This stage of the project not only quantifies the model's forecasting ability but also sets the stage for future enhancements and potential applications.
